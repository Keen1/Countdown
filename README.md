#Countdown! A simple timer and stopwatch app written in C.
this is a little project I'm working on to further my skills in C programming. 

##TODO:
###ALL
* Some of the button behavior is undesirable. Need clearly defined functionality and constraints on buttons.
* Increase the font size of the hh/mm/ss label.
* Add options for user to change color of hh/mm/ss label

###TIMER
* Add color shifting functionality to the hh/mm/ss label
* Add alert sounds to signify the end of the timer.
  * Allow the user to choose different alert sounds to use(can prob fit in same menu area as the ability to change color of label(uni settings)
* Add an audio countdown for the last 10 seconds of the timer
